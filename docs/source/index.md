# Welcome to Eindir

`eindir` is a foundational framework for working with functions, used for
example by `anneal`, a cutting-edge simulated annealing package designed for
optimization and simulation tasks. It provides a robust platform for developing
efficient, high-performance simulated opitmization oriented solutions with minimal
dependencies and a focus on ease of integration.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Data Handling**: Offers sophisticated classes for managing
  position-value pairs, crucial in optimization algorithms.

- **Boundary Management**: Implements functionality to enforce numerical limits,
  ensuring solutions remain within feasible bounds.

- **Objective Function Interface**: Defines an abstract base for objective
  functions, allowing for flexible and customized optimization logic.

- **Visualization Tools**: Includes modules for creating insightful 2D and 3D
  visualizations of the optimization landscape.

Eindir's minimal dependencies and pure Python implementation make it an
accessible and powerful tool for a wide range of optimization tasks.
